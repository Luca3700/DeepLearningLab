It contains low resolution ($28 \\times 28$) grey-scale images representing different kind of clothes. The dataset is available on keras and accessable in $\\texttt{tf.keras.datasets.fashion\\_mnist}$. Note that the pixel values for the images are initially in the interval $[0, 255]$. It is required to normalize them since all of the algorithm we will use require them to be in that format. To be fair, you will find the dataset already normalized, do not modify that part of the code.\n","\n","## Metrics\n","\n","Measuring the quality of newly generated images is a non-trivial task. Indeed, there is no label associated to each image, and thus it is impossible to measure the quality image-by-image. For that reason, common metrics uses statistical consideration on a generated dataset to test how well the network recovered the statistics of the original data. One of the most common is the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID). The idea of FID is that in a realistic-looking dataset of images, the statistics of the activation of the last hidden layer in a well-trained classificator should be similar to that of a dataset containing real images. Specifically, regarding FID, the Inception-v3 network is used as a classificator. A real dataset $\\mathbb{D}_r$ and a generated dataset $\\mathbb{D}_g$ are processed by the network, and the activation of the last hidden layer has mean and variance $(\\mu_r, \\Sigma_r)$, $(\\mu_g, \\Sigma_g)$ respectively. Then, FID is computed as:\n","\n","$$\n","    FID(\\mathbb{D}_r, \\mathbb{D}_g) = || \\mu_r - \\mu_g ||^2 + Tr(\\Sigma_r + \\Sigma_g - 2(\\Sigma_r \\ast \\Sigma_g)^{\\frac{1}{2}}) \n","$$\n","\n","A Python implementation of FID can be found in the file $\\texttt{fid.py}$ that you find attached on Virtuale. Its usage is very simple, just generate $10k$ fake images with your GAN, and with the command $\\texttt{fid.get\\_fid(x\\_test, x\\_gen)}$, where $\\texttt{x\\_test}$ is the test set, containing $10k$ real images, you get the value for the FID of your network. Remember that, when passed through that function, $\\texttt{x\\_gen}$ **must** be a dataset of $10k$ images, in the interval $[0, 1]$. The number of $10k$ images is fundamental, since the value of FID strongly depends on the number of input images.\n","\n","## Limitations\n","\n","You are required to implement a vanilla Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), not a variant of it (e.g. PixelGAN, CycleGAN, ... are **not** accepted). The maximum number of parameters is *15 million*, and every pre-trained network can be used as an add-on (the number of parameters for pre-trained network does not count). Clearly, only the training set can be used to train the network, no additional images (Data Augmentation is ok)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"aaubgTXbTazn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1684011238479,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":8296,"user":{"displayName":"Luca Torzi","userId":"02190015905345383089"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","from tensorflow.keras import layers\n","from tensorflow.keras.datasets import fashion_mnist\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","from matplotlib import pyplot as plt"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ceos7zgTTazs"},"source":["The images are normalized in $[0, 1]$.
